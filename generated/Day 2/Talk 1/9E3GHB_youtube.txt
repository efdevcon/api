In this talk we'll go over how to build privacy-protecting infrastructure. What is it, why do we need it and how can we build it?

We'll look at Waku, the communication layer for Web3. We'll see how it uses ZKPs to incentivize and protect the Waku network. We'll also look at Zerokit, a library that makes it easier to use ZKPs in different environments.

After this talk, I hope you'll better understand the importance of privacy-protecting infrastructure and how we can build it.
