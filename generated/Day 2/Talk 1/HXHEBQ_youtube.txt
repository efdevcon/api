We propose to present a panel with representatives of at least five Ethereum communities in Latam in order to review what has been achieved so far, the main challenges they face and the vision they have regarding the future.
From this discussion, the audience will be able to draw conclusions regarding the degree of progress of the different communities, understand the particular difficulties of each country and identify if there is a common vision for Latam.

Speaker(s): Toño Romero, Ana Belén || AnaTech, Solange Gueiros, Crisgarner, Juan David Reyes, Romina Ayelén Sejas
Track: Opportunity & Global Impact
