The staking industry is on the verge of a new and exciting innovation cycle. The modularization of the staking tech stack, led by advances in middleware solutions such as Obol Network (Distributed Validator Technology), Flashbots (MEV Boost), Liquid Collective (liquid staking), and EigenLayer will create a new playing field for existing operators, product builders and solo stakers.

This panel seeks to discuss these important developments and the new benefits and risks they bring to Ethereum.

Speaker(s): Collin Myers, Sreeram Kannan, Viktor Bunin | Coinbase Cloud, Stephane Gosselin
Track: Staking & Validator Experience
Keywords: Staking,Validators
