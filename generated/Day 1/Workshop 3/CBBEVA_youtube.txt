Right now, the DAO ecosystem is built around one-token-one-vote or one-cpu-one-vote schemes.

With strong sybil resistence, the ecosystem could move to DAOs built on one-human-one-vote. This unlocks more democratic use cases like:

- quadratic funding
- quadratic voting
- Gini coefficient measurements
- UBI
- one-person-one-vote DAOs
- data collectives
- sybil resistant airdrops
+ more

Learn about the current landscape of sybil resistance techniques in web3.
