Bringing non-web3 native users into a dApp is always a fraught, friction filled experience, even with cheaper transaction costs on rollups. In this talk, we will show you how you can modify a dApp using BLS signatures & a smart contract wallet to:
 
 - Embed a wallet directly in your dApp, and allow users to eject by swapping its public key.
 - Bundle multiple transactions into one and submit to an aggregator to lower friction & save on gas.
 - Pay for your user's transactions.
