We highlight two challenges of parallel execution on Ethereum: 1. Historical data shows that data dependencies force us to execute a large portion of transactions serially. 2. If we assign incentives to scheduling decisions, this might introduce non-determinism that the system cannot tolerate. In this lightning talk, we present these two problems and outline some proposed solutions.
