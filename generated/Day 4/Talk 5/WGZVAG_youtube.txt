Web3 opens the door to a new cyberspace—one not only occupied, but governed, by its citizens.

[The Optimism Collective](http://optimism.io/vision) is our attempt to correct meatspace's market failures with an L2.

But this talk isn't on scaling. It's about...

...the past: why Ethereum is not an opportunity, but a responsibility.

...the present: what we're doing to take this seriously & how it impacts our governance designs.

...the future: the path towards summoning Ether's Phoenix.
