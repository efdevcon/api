This is a panel discussion about the EVM.

We want to be a bit more unconventional and would like to transform the room into a "live voting space" where attendees can fight for their favourite new EVM feature.

Different proposals will be listed and discussed for 3-5 minutes each, where invited panelists give a short opinion followed by loud interaction from the audience.

Speaker(s): Alex Beregszaszi, Paweł Bylica
Track: Developer Infrastructure
Keywords: evm
