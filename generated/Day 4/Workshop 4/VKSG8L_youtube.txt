This workshop aims to be an essential introduction to Ethereum PoS consensus by inspecting its underlying infrastructure.

We will first demystify concepts such as Execution + Consensus layer, PoS validation, Keys and Signatures, and Slashing. 

You will learn by watching when we demo how to spin up a validator using the Lighthouse validator client. 

You will learn by doing when we give you some time to spin up a validator yourself and experiment with the setup.
